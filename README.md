# LeetCode Practice Repository

Hi there! This repo is where I practice **LeetCode problems** step by step.  
I focus on solving problems based on **patterns** and also **Top Interview Questions**.

---

## Goal

- Practice algorithms and data structures
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Learn common problem patterns
- Prepare for technical interviews

---

## How I Use This Repo

I organize my LeetCode practice like this:

- Each folder corresponds to a difficulty level (Easy / Medium / Hard)  
- Inside each difficulty, problems are grouped by **category/pattern** (Arrays, Linked List, Trees, etc.)  
- I add my solutions in languages I prefer (Java / C++)  
- I sometimes add quick notes or short explanations for reference

## Notes

- This repo is for personal learning and practice only
- All problems are from LeetCode
- I update it whenever I solve new problems
